# Awesome Koa Project

Welcome to the Awesome Koa Project! ðŸš€

_Read the [Chinese version](./README-cn.md) of this document._

## Introduction

Koa is a powerful and lightweight web framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity and extensive use of async/await. Understanding its core concepts is crucial for building efficient and scalable web applications.

### Core Concepts

- **Request:** Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Response:** Manages outgoing HTTP responses.
- **Context:** Provides a context for each request, encapsulating request and response objects.
- **Application:** The main Koa instance orchestrating middleware and handling requests.

### Features

- **Lightweight/Simple:** Koa is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use.
- **Async/Await Support:** Leverages modern JavaScript features for asynchronous programming.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Koa, follow these simple steps:

```bash
npm install koa
```

### Configuration

Understand Koa's working principle, including the Onion Model:

#### Common Middleware

- **Router:** Efficient routing with [koa-router](https://github.com/koajs/router).
- **CORS:** Cross-origin resource sharing made easy with [@koa/cors](https://github.com/koajs/cors).
- **Compression:** Enhance performance using [koa-compose](https://github.com/koajs/compose).
- **Static Resources:** Serve static files effortlessly with [koa-static](https://github.com/koajs/static).
- **Protocol Handling:** JSON and body parsing with [koa-json](https://github.com/koajs/json) and [koa-body](https://github.com/koajs/body).
- **Security:** Secure your app with authentication via [koa-session](https://github.com/koajs/session) and [koa-jwt](https://github.com/koajs/jwt), and set secure headers with [koa-helmet](https://github.com/venables/koa-helmet).
- **Logging:** Simplify logging with [koa-logger](https://github.com/koajs/logger).

#### Common API

- `app.use`: Implement middleware functions.
- `app.listen`: Start the server.
- `app.on`: Listen for events.
